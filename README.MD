# Social Team Builder With Django

This project builds a site where people can sign up to find projects that need help or post their own projects for other people to join. Users are able to create a brief profile for themselves after they sign up with an avatar, a bio, and pick their skills from a list. Users can post a project, too, giving it a title and description. They can list the positions they need filled for that job with a brief description of what the position will be responsible for. Users are able to find a project and ask to join it. If you're a project owner, you can approve or deny the person asking to join.
